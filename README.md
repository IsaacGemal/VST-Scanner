# VST-Scanner
Scans VSTs on your PC, making life easier for music producers.
Just download the python script and run it.
Feel free to modify the directories to your liking by modifying the vst_directories list.
Only works for windows right now.

Also, I added a similar app that scans the registry for all installed programs.
